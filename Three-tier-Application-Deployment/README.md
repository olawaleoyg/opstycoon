Deploying a three-tier application on Kubernetes involves organizing your system into three distinct layers for optimal functionality and management.

Check NOTE.txt for details

Pre-requisites

Knowledge On Basic understanding on how these cloud tools and services works
Terraform
SSH
Amazon EC2
IAM (Identity and Access Management)
Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
Kubernetes Cluster
Helm

Step 1. Create an IAM user

![alt text](../../img/user.png)

click on user →create user, Give a name to your user and tick on provide user access to management console and then click on I want an IAM user option

choose a password for your user →click next, Attach the policies directly to your iam user → click next

note →I will provide the administrator access for now but we careful while attaching the policies at your workspace

review and create user, click on create user, download your password file if it is autogenerated otherwise it is your’s choice

Now click on your IAM user →security credentials, scroll down to access keys and create an access keys
choose aws cli from the options listed
click next and download you csv file for username and password, I choose to copy this in a notepad instead, DON'T Copy this in your readme (Your account could be banned or restricted) if publicly exposed unknowningly

open your aws console and navigate to ec2 and click on launch ec2
give it a name you want, I choose opstycoon,

I created a terraform to spine up the the ec2 instance instantly, fast and manage it easily, and easily destroy it after use.

If you choose to create take the same approach which i recommended to make use of IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code)

I created a main.tf

After this I configure my aws,


aws configure
(This will prompt you to insert the access key and the secret key you saved during the IAM creation)
enter your region and the format is json

---

Or You can use theAWS console if you choose

---

Connect to your instance and run the following commands

I SSH into my instance from terminal instead of using the console

`(ssh -i "my-key.pem" ubuntu@public-ip-here)`

Lets run
(sudo su - will allow you to work as a super-user;root-user), then update and create the folder

```
$ sudo su
$ apt update
$ mkdir opstycoon
$ cd opstycoon
```
